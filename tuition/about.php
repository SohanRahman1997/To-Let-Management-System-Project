    <p>Tuition Management System will be a web based online system which will provide tuition facilities to people, specially to the tutors, students/parents. 
    As the number of web surfers are increasing day by day, a web based solution will be more helpful than physically searching for tuition. 
    The system will have different level of user. The one who is not registered as a user will only be able to view the basic Dashboard page.</p>
